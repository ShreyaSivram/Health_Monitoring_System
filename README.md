# Health_Monitoring_System
This project integrates multiple environmental and health sensors with an ESP32 microcontroller to create a web server that displays real-time data. The sensors used include a DHT11 for temperature and humidity measurements, a DS18B20 for temperature readings, and an analog heartbeat sensor for monitoring heart rate.
